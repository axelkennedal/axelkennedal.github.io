# About
I'm a computer science student who likes to share knowledge.

Currently I'm in my second year at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, the premier technical university of Sweden,
<a href="https://blog.hackerrank.com/which-universities-have-the-best-coders-in-the-word/" target="_blank">ranked 10 in the world</a> at creating good programmers.
Now and then I come across a problem (related to computer science / programming / development) that I can't find
a good solution for online, that's when I write about it here - or when I just find something cool I want to
tell the world about.

You can find my curriculum vitae <a href="https://www.cakeresume.com/axel-kennedal" target="_blank">here</a>.
